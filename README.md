## Second-Start Notice

This GitHub account represents a **rebuild after permanent loss of my original profile**.  
All ongoing research, publications, and future releases now continue under:

🔁 **https://github.com/GOVINDFROMINDIA**

This profile is my primary, stable academic identity going forward.

## Research Focus

My work aims to build **transparent, verifiable, and trustworthy AI systems** that move beyond shallow pattern-matching toward **robust reasoning and interpretable AGI**.

**Core themes:**

- **LLM Reasoning & Cognitive Modeling**  
  Chain-of-thought behavior • multi-step logical inference • reasoning trace faithfulness

- **AGI Explainability & Safety**  
  Mechanistic interpretability of transformers • attribution & attention analysis • guardrails and safety policies

- **Trustworthy Machine Learning**  
  Bias and robustness under distribution shift • federated and decentralized trust modeling • uncertainty and calibration

- **Deep Learning Systems**  
  Multimodal architectures • graph-based reasoning • responsible deployment of generative and agentic models
